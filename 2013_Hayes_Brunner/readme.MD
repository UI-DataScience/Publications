## Abstract
We use a quadratic estimator with KL-compression to calculate the angular power spectrum of a volume-limited Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample out to ℓ=200ℓ=200. We also determine the angular power spectrum of selected subsamples with photometric redshifts z<0.3z<0.3 and 0.3<z<0.40.3<z<0.4 to examine the possible evolution of the angular power spectrum, as well as early-type and late-type galaxy subsamples to examine the relative linear bias. In addition, we calculate the angular power spectrum of the SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample in a ∼53.7∼53.7 square degree area out to l=1600l=1600 to determine the SDSS DR7 angular power spectrum to high multipoles. We perform a χ2χ2 fit to compare the resulting angular power spectra to theoretical nonlinear angular power spectra to extract cosmological parameters and the linear bias. We find the best-fit cosmological parameters of Ωm=0.267±0.038Ωm=0.267±0.038 and Ωb=0.045±0.012Ωb=0.045±0.012. We find an overall linear bias of b=1.075±0.056b=1.075±0.056, an early-type bias of be=1.727±0.065be=1.727±0.065, and a late-type bias of bl=1.256±0.051bl=1.256±0.051. Finally, we present evidence of a selective misclassification of late-type galaxies as stars by the SDSS photometric data reduction pipeline in areas of high stellar density (e.g., at low Galactic latitudes).
