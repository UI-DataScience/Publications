	abstract = {Context. Photometric redshifts (photo-z's) have become an essential tool in extragalactic astronomy. Many current and upcoming observing
programmes require great accuracy of photo-z's to reach their scientific goals. Aims: Here we introduce PHAT, the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing programme, an international initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-z estimation. Methods: Two different test environments are set up, one (PHAT0) based on simulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, and another one (PHAT1) based on data from the GOODS survey including 18-band photometry and {\textasciitilde}2000 spectroscopic redshifts. Results: The accuracy of the different methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter, and outlier rates. While most methods agree very well on PHAT0 there are differences in the handling of the Lyman-α forest for
higher redshifts. Furthermore, different methods produce photo-z scatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case. A larger spread in accuracy is found for PHAT1. Few methods benefit from the addition of mid-IR photometry. The accuracy of the other methods is unaffected or suffers when IRAC data are included. Remaining biases and systematic effects can be explained by shortcomings in the different template sets (especially in the mid-IR) and the use of priors on the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. Some strategies to overcome these problems are identified by comparing the methods in detail. Scatters of 4-8\% in Δz/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. However, somewhat larger outlier rates ({\textgreater}7.5\% with Δz/(1+z){\textgreater}0.15; {\textgreater}4.5\% after
cleaning) are found for all codes that can only partly be explained by AGN or issues in the photometry or the spec-z catalogue. Some outliers were probably missed in comparisons of photo-z's to other, less complete spectroscopic surveys in the past. There is a general trend that empirical codes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. Conclusions: The systematic, quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshot of the current
state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard for the assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. The rather large outlier rates reported here for PHAT1 on real data should be investigated further since they are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many other studies. The test data sets are publicly available and can be used to compare new, upcoming methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z method development.

	abstract = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took 
data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the
original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a
new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical
interferometer. All of the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In
particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all
data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data
acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data
releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our
previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of
galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) over an additional 3000 deg2 of sky, more than triples
the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point
Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes
repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the
Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS).
The APOGEE outputs now include the measured abundances of 15 different
elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 5200 deg2 of
ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan
Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey;
2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and
247,216 stars over 9376 deg2; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of
156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5513 stars. Since its
first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in
five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6082},
	abstract = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over \$96{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving \$97.84{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over \$90{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a \$99.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

After correcting for systematic effects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative to mass clustering predicted from the Planck \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, finding agreement with CFHTLS measurements with \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedom for the TPZ (BPZ) redshifts. We test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxy clustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matter clustering. The precision of the data allow us to determine that the linear bias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to \$2.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy down to scales at least \$4\$ to \$10\$ times smaller than those on which linear theory is expected to be sufficient.},

radial velocity search for planets around {\textasciitilde}8000 stars. This paper
describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting

of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing
the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or
over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been
reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final,
self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination.
This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2),
consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high
and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar
spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed
through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better
determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

	abstract = {We use N-body/photometric galaxy simulations to examine the impact of sample variance of spectroscopic redshift samples on the accuracy of photometric redshift (photo-z) determination and calibration of photo-z errors. We estimate the biases in the cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing and derive requirements on the spectroscopic follow-up for three different photo-z algorithms chosen to broadly span the range of algorithms available. We find that sample variance is much more relevant for the photo-z error calibration than for photo-z training, implying that follow-up requirements are similar for different algorithms. We demonstrate that the spectroscopic sample can be used for training of photo-zs and error calibration without incurring additional bias in the cosmological parameters. We provide a guide for observing proposals for the spectroscopic follow-up to ensure that redshift calibration biases do not dominate the cosmological parameter error budget. For example, assuming optimistically (pessimistically) that the weak lensing shear measurements from the Dark Energy Survey could obtain 1σ constraints on the dark energy equation of state w of 0.035 (0.055), implies a follow-up requirement of 150 (40) patches of sky with a telescope such as Magellan, assuming a 1/8 deg2 effective field of view and 400 galaxies per patch. Assuming (optimistically) a VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey-like spectroscopic completeness with purely random failures, this could be accomplished with about 75 (20) nights of observation. For more realistic assumptions regarding spectroscopic completeness, or with the presence of other sources of systematics not considered here, further degradations to dark energy constraints are possible. We test several approaches for making the requirements less stringent. For example, if the redshift distribution of the overall sample can be estimated by some other technique, e.g. cross-correlation, then follow-up requirements could be reduced by an order of magnitude.},

We assess the photometric redshift performance using about 15000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. These galaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, and photo-\$z\$'s are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-\$z\$ codes. A weighting method in a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space is applied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-\$z\$ performance with sets that mimic the full DES photometric sample, which is on average significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limited depth of spectroscopic surveys. Empirical photo-\$z\$ methods using, for instance, Artificial Neural Networks or Random Forests, yield the best performance in the tests, achieving core photo-\$z\$ resolutions \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{68\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.08\$. Moreover, the results from most of the codes, including template fitting methods, comfortably meet the DES requirements on photo-\$z\$ performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future DES data sets.},

The increased number of photometric bands available for the redshift solution results in improvements both in the rms error and, especially, in the outlier rate.

	abstract = {With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ. This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analyzed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the SDSS main galaxy sample and from the DEEP2 survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.},

These galaxies of 17-23 mag in B span a wide range of intrinsic color and are thus unlike previous samples of faint galaxies that were largely radio or cluster galaxies of early (red) type. For redshifts less than 0.35, two-thirds of the color redshifts agree with the spectroscopic values to within + or - 0.04 in z; for higher redshifts to z of 0.6, the errors increase to + or - 0.06.

	abstract = {Photometric surveys produce large-area maps of the galaxy distribution, but with less accurate redshift information than is obtained from spectroscopic methods. Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colors, that are obtained through multi-band imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin widths are \${\textbackslash}Delta z=0.1\$, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from 5\%, when using single point estimates, to 3\%.},

	abstract = {Advances in Machine Learning and Data Mining for Astronomy documents numerous successful collaborations among computer scientists, statisticians, and astronomers who illustrate the application of state-of-the-art machine learning and data mining techniques in astronomy. Due to the massive amount and complexity of data in most scientific disciplines, the material discussed in this text transcends traditional boundaries between various areas in the sciences and computer science.  The book’s introductory part provides context to issues in the astronomical sciences that are also important to health, social, and physical sciences, particularly probabilistic and statistical aspects of classification and cluster analysis. The next part describes a number of astrophysics case studies that leverage a range of machine learning and data mining technologies. In the last part, developers of algorithms and practitioners of machine learning and data mining show how these tools and techniques are used in astronomical applications.  With contributions from leading astronomers and computer scientists, this book is a practical guide to many of the most important developments in machine learning, data mining, and statistics. It explores how these advances can solve current and future problems in astronomy and looks at how they could lead to the creation of entirely new algorithms within the data mining community.},

competitive tool when compared with traditional template-fitting methods. The ANNz package is demonstrated on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1, and for this particular data set the rms redshift error in the range 0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.7 is σrms=0.023.
Nonideal conditions (spectroscopic sets that are small or brighter than the photometric set for which redshifts are required) are simulated, and the impact on the photometric redshift accuracy is assessed.2},

optically faint radio source identifications believed to be faint
elliptical galaxies were carried out. Photometric redshift estimates
have been made using three different models: a nonevolving elliptical
galaxy spectrum, an evolving spectrum based on one of Bruzual's
calculations, and an empirical model derived from photometry of distant
elliptical galaxies. Redshifts greater than 0.5 are systematically
under-estimated by the first two models and for galaxies whose colors
are not consistent with the models, deviations occur not only in the
optical bands but also in the infrared. The difficulties are not
resolved by the addition of a quasar-like nucleus to the galaxies.},

	abstract = {One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the widespread adoption of photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain images of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analyzing all of these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to compute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of a sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-\$z\$ PDFs. By using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian and Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for the same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can be stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the CFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are sufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift distribution, \$N(z)\$, to an accuracy of 99.9\% when compared to the one built using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of \${\textbackslash}delta z = 0.01\$, reducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten to twenty. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be directly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational performance without losing resolution nor accuracy.},

	abstract = {As a means of better understanding the evolution of optically selected galaxies we consider the distribution of galaxies within the multicolor space \$U\$, \$B\_J\$, \$R\_F\$ and \$I\_N\$. We find that they form an almost planar distribution out to \$B\_J =22.5\$ and \$z{\textless}0.3\$. The position of a galaxy within this plane is dependent on its redshift, luminosity and spectral type. While in the original \$U\$, \$B\_J\$, \$R\_F\$ and \$I\_N\$ space these properties are highly correlated we can define an optimal rotation of the photometric axes that makes much of this information orthogonal. Fitting the observed spectroscopic redshifts with a quadratic function of the four magnitudes we show that redshifts for galaxies can be estimated to an accuracy better than \${\textbackslash}Delta z =0.05\$. This dispersion is due to the photometric uncertainties within the photographic data. Assuming no galaxy evolution we derive a set of simulated galaxy fluxes in the U, J, F and N passbands. Using these data we investigate how the redshift is encoded within the broadband magnitudes and the intrinsic dispersion of the photometric-redshift relation. We find that the signal that defines a galaxy's photometric redshift is not related to specific absorption or emission lines but comes from the break in the overall shape of the galaxy continuum at around 4000 {\textbackslash}AA. Using high signal-to-noise photometric data we estimate that it is possible to achieve an intrinsic dispersion of less than \${\textbackslash}Delta z =0.02\$.},
