## Abstract 
When large data sets of galaxies are collected, their associated redshifts are usually collected
by finding their photometric redshifts, which takes additional time for a survery to complete.
However, if deep learning via deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are utilized,
photometric redshifts of galaxies can be predicted without the need for photometry to be
completed by the associated survey. In this paper, we present an application of ConvNets on
reduced and pixelated galaxy images and redshift data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). We will show that ConvNets are able to accurately predict the redshift of a sample
galaxy image in a way that is competitive with previous works on this subject.
