## Abstract
We present the galaxy two-point angular correlation function for galaxies selected from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy sample was selected with rr-band apparent magnitudes between 1717 and 2121; and we measure the correlation function for the full sample as well as for the four magnitude ranges: 1717–1818, 1818–1919, 1919–2020, and 2020–2121. We update the flag criteria to select a clean galaxy catalog and detail specific tests that we perform to characterize systematic effects, including the effects of seeing, Galactic extinction, and the overall survey uniformity. Notably, we find that optimally we can use observed regions with seeing <1.5′′<1.5′′, and rr-band extinction <0.13<0.13 magnitudes, smaller than previously published results. Furthermore, we confirm that the uniformity of the SDSS photometry is minimally affected by the stripe geometry. We find that, overall, the two-point angular correlation function can be described by a power law, ω(θ)=Aωθ(1−γ)ω(θ)=Aωθ(1−γ) with γ≃1.72γ≃1.72, over the range 0.005∘0.005∘–10∘10∘. We also find similar relationships for the four magnitude subsamples, but the amplitude within the same angular interval for the four subsamples is found to decrease with fainter magnitudes, in agreement with previous results. We find that the systematic signals are well below the galaxy angular correlation function for angles less than approximately 5∘5∘, which limits the modeling of galaxy angular correlations on larger scales. Finally, we present our custom, highly parallelized two-point correlation code that we used in this analysis.
